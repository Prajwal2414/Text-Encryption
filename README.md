# Text-Encryption
This Python-based encryption tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using multiple cryptographic algorithms: AES, DES, and RSA. It is designed for educational and security research purposes, helping learners understand how symmetric and asymmetric encryption works in real-world applications.

✅ Features
Encrypt & decrypt text using:

-AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
-DES (Data Encryption Standard)
-RSA (Asymmetric Encryption)
-Simple command-line interface
-Works with Python in VS Code

**** HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAMME ****

1.✅ Save all required files (e.g., Text_Encryptor.py, any key or input files) in the same folder.

2.🧭 Open VS Code (or any Python IDE you prefer).

3.💻 Open the terminal inside VS Code:
---------- Press Ctrl + ~
---------- OR go to View → Terminal

4.📁 Change the directory to your script's folder by running:
---------- cd path\to\your\project\folder
Example--- cd C:\Folder Name

5.▶️ Run the Python script:
--------- python Text_Encryptor.py

6.📄 The result will appear in your terminal (for print outputs), or in your folder (for generated files like encrypted text or keys).
